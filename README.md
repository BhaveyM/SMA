steganography-messaging app extention

## About

Our project idea is to provide the most secure way of sending and receiving messages. We
plan to achieve it through the concept of steganography. This is a web extension where 
users can share data with each other through images, these images will contain encoded 
messages/any type of file. This method is highly secure and efficient than cryptography.
What makes this project unique is that it does not use the conventional method of storing
data in least significant pixels but utilizes binary to store the data in particular order of 
pixels according to the applied algorithm. Additional benefits - No message is stored in any 
sort of database and multiple alogorithms can be used to secure it in multi-layer deep encrypion.
