steganography-messaging app extention

## About

Our project idea is to provide the most secure way of sending and receiving messages. We
plan to achieve it through the concept of steganography. To demonstrate it, we are building
a messaging portal where users can interact with each other via images, these images contain
hidden encoded messages/any type of file. This method is more secure and efficient than
cryptography.
